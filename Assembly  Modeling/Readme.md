# **Assembly Modeling Practice**

This folder contains resources and models specifically designed for **assembly modeling questions** in the **Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate (CSWA)** exam.

## **Contents**
### **SOLIDWORKS Files**
- **Assembly Files**:  
  - `Scissors lift.SLDASM` – The full assembly of the scissors lift.

- **Part Files**:  
  - `Long shaft.SLDPRT` – A long shaft used in the assembly.  
  - `Pivot.SLDPRT` – A pivot component for rotational connections.  
  - `Long Pin.SLDPRT` – A longer pin for structural connections.  
  - `Short Pin.SLDPRT` – A shorter pin for smaller connections.  
  - `Link.SLDPRT` – A connecting link in the scissors lift.  
  - `Upper base.SLDPRT` – The upper base of the lift.  
  - `Lower base.SLDPRT` – The lower base of the lift.

### **Supporting Documents**
- **Practice set 2 - Assembly modeling.pdf** – A question set for practicing assembly modeling tasks.

### **Images**
- **Scissors_lift.JPG** – A rendered image of the scissors lift model.

## **Scissors Lift Model**
![Scissors Lift](Scissors_lift.JPG)

This is a 3D model of a scissors lift designed in SOLIDWORKS. It demonstrates advanced assembly techniques and is included as part of the assembly modeling practice set.

### **Features of the Model**
- Incorporates multiple parts in a dynamic assembly.  
- Allows for mechanism simulation for motion studies.  
- Emphasizes design principles for stability and precision.

## **How to Use This Folder**
1. Open the SOLIDWORKS files in your version of SOLIDWORKS (2017 or later).  
2. Use the **Practice set 2 - Assembly modeling.pdf** to follow the question set and complete exercises.  
3. Explore and analyze the parts and assemblies for better understanding.

## **Credits**
The resources and models in this folder are inspired by and adapted from content available on the **[Productivity Hub YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@productivityhub4597)**. Be sure to check out their channel for more amazing SOLIDWORKS tutorials and tips!
